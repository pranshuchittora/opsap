<h2 align="center">OPSAP Contest - Guidelines</h2>

Hello Developers!

SRMKZILLA welcomes you to this contest, brought to you by OnePlus Student Ambassador Program'20.

Here are some basic guidelines to keep in mind while you show your tech skills with your app:

*   While we are all about collaborating and sharing ideas, we don’t appreciate teamwork in this contest. Any form of plagiarism is _**strictly prohibited**_ and will lead to disqualification.
*   We know you’re pumped, but you can have only one submission for your app.
*   Make sure to give [the instructions](https://github.com/srm-kzilla/opsap/blob/main/INSTRUCTIONS.md) a good read before you start developing your awesome application.
*   Just to keep up with your pace, there are bonus tasks that you can complete.

Should you have any questions, we’re here to answer them. Feel free to ask your heart out in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/NsDYz29).
